# 42-Lisbon-Common-Core-Libft
Libft is a project that involves re-implementing a variety of essential C standard library functions, such as ft_strlen, ft_memcpy, and ft_strdup. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these functions and gain a deeper understanding of memory management. This library will serve as a foundation for future projects and assignments.
